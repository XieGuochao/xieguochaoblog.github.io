    A very good experience with Jack Kolb. This course covers much more than **CSC 3150** in CUHK(SZ) and the workloads are relatively heavier than other courses; however, we can learn about triple than what we can learn from the matched course. The outcomes worth more efforts to put on this course. I suggest those with excellent programming skills shoudl take this course!
