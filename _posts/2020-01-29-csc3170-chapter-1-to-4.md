# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Purpose of Database Systems

- Data **redundancy** and **inconsistency**: data is stored in multiple _file formats_ resulting in _duplication of information_ in different files
- Difficulty in **accessing** data
  - Need to write a _new program_ to carry out each new task
- Data **isolation**
  - Multiple _files and formats_
- **Integrity** problems
  - Integrity _constraints_ (e.g., account balance > 0) become “buried” in program code rather than being stated explicitly
  - Hard to add _new constraints_ or _change_ existing ones
- **Atomicity** of updates
  - Failures may leave database in an _inconsistent_ state with _partial updates_ carried out
  - Example: Transfer of funds from one account to another should either complete or not happen at all
- **Concurrent** access by multiple users
  - Concurrent access needed for _performance_
  - Uncontrolled concurrent accesses can lead to _inconsistencies_
    - Ex: Two people reading a balance (say 100) and updating it by withdrawing money (say 50 each) at the same time
- **Security** problems
  - Hard to provide _user_ _access_ to some, but not all, data

## Data Models

Data models are a collection of tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics (meaning of data), and data constraints.

- Relational model
- Entity-Relationship data model (_mainly for database design_)
- Object-based data models (_Object-oriented_ and _Object-relational_)
- Semi-structured data model (_XML_)
- Network model
- Hierachical model

## View of Data

3 levels: view, logical, physical

## Instances and Schemas

- Logical Schema: ≈ type information of a variable in a program
- Physical Schema:
  - Physical Data **Independence**: the ability to modify the physical schema _without_ changing the logical schema
- Instance: the actual content at a particular point in time ≈ the value of a variable

## Languages

- Data Definition Language (DDL):
  - a set of _table templates_ stored in a _data dictionary
  - Metadata:
    - Database **schema**
    - **Integrity** constraints (e.g. Primary Key)
    - **Authorization**
- Data Manipulation language (DML):
  - **Query language**: the portion of a DML that involves information retrieval
  - 2 classes:
    - **Pure**: used for providing _properties_ about computational power and for optimization:
      - Relational Algebra
      - Tuple relational calculus
      - Domain relational calculus
    - **Commercial**:
      - _SQL_ is the _most widely used_ commercial language
  - 2 types:
    - **Procedural** DML: _both_ what data are needed adn how to get data.
    - **Declarative** DML (non-procedural): _only_ what data are needed.

## SQL Query Language

SQL query language is **nonprocedural**. 

It is **NOT** a [Turing machine equivalent language](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/automata_theory/turing_machine_introduction.htm)?

## Database Access from Application Program

**Host languages** are requried for complex computations and actions. **Application programs** are programs that are used to interact with the database.

## Database Engine and Components

The functional components of a database system:

- Storage manager
- Query processor component
- Transaction management component

### Storage Manager

A storage manager provides the **interface** between the low-level data and the application programs and queries submitted to the system. It interacts with the _OS file manager_, stores, retrieves, and updates data efficiently.

Included in a storage manager is the following:

- Authorization and integrity manager
- Transaction manager
- File manager
- Buffer manager

Data structures of a storage manager include

- Data files
- Data dictionary
- Indices, which provide fast access to data items

### Query Processor

A query processor includes a DDL interpreter, a DML compiler (with query optimization), and a query evaluation engine.

The query processing procedure follows:

query -> parser and translator -> relational-algebra expression -> optimizer (from statistics about data) -> execution plan -> evaluation engine (access data) -> query output

### Transaction Management

**Transation** is a collection of operations that performs a _single_ logical function. **Transaction-management** component ensures the _consistency_ of the system despite failure. **Concurrency-control** management handles _concurrent_ transactions to ensure the _consistency_.

## Database Architecture

Types of architecture include:

- Centralized databases
- Client-server
- Parallel databases
- Distributed databases: geographical distribution; schema/data heterogeneity (different from each other).

## Database Applications

For **two-tier** architecture, the application on the client side *directly* accesses the database system; on the other hand, for **three-tier** one, the client mahcine does *not* directly call the database but communicates with an *application server*, which is responsible for communication with the database.

## Database Users

There are 4 types of database-system users:

1. Naive users (using application programs).
2. Application programmers (writing application programs).
3. Sophisticated users (using query language or tools).
4. Specialized users (writing specialized database applications).

## Database Administrator (DBA)

The person who has central control over the system.

# Chapter 2: Intro to Relational Model

## Relation Schema and Instance

A relation consists of _attributes_ (columns) and _tuples_ (rows). To represent relation schema, we adopt the following syntax:

1. $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$: attributes
2. $R = (A_1, A_2, ..., A_n)$: relation schema
3. $r(R)$: instance
4. $t$ of $r$: a tuple

Relations are unordered.

### Attributes

- **Domain**: all allowed values for each attribute
- **Atomic** attribute value
- _null_ is a member of every domain.

### Database Schema vs Instance

Database schema is the logical structure and database instance is a snapshot.

### Keys

- **Superkey**: sufficient to identify a unique tuple.
- **Candidate key**: minimal superkey.
- **Primary key**: one of the candidate keys.
- **Foreign key**: value in one relation must appear in another, _Referencing_ relation and _Referenced_ relation.

### Relational Query Languages

- Pure languages include _relational algebra_, _tuple_ relational calculus and _domain_ relational calculus. They are **equivalent** in computing power.

The relational algebra consists of 6 basic operations:

# Chapter 3: Entity-Relationship Model

## Design

In the initial phase, we need to _characterize_ fully the data needs for the users.

Then, in the second phase, we will _translate_ requirements into a _conceptual_ schema of the database, which indicates the functional requirements of teh enterprise. More specifically, we need to describe the kinds of _operations_ and _transactions_.

The final step is _implementation_. We decide teh database schema and physical layout of the database.

Two major pitfalls are **redundancy** and **incompleteness**. Redundancy may cause data _inconsistency_ among various copies of information, and a bad design may lead to difficulty of modelling.

## Design Approaches

### Entity-Relationship Model

**Entity** is an object that is distinguishable from others and is described by a set of attributes, and **relationship** represents an association among several entities.

### Normalization Theory

Normalization Theory is used to formalize designs and test for them.

## Entity (Sets)

An **entity** is an object and an **entity set** is a set of entites (like a _class_). An entity is represented by a set of attributes, e.g. instructor = (ID, name, salary).

To represent entity sets, we use ER Diagram:

![](/assets/img/contents/ER_diagram_example.png)

## Relationship (Sets)

A **relationship** is an association among several entities and a **relationship set** is a mathematical relation among n ≥ 2 entities.

In the ER Diagram, we use **diamonds** to represent relationship sets.

## Roles

A _relationship_ may consist of several _entity sets_ of the **same** type. For each **occurrence** of an entity set, it plays a "**role**" in the relationship. For example, a "prereq" relationship may have "course_id" and "prereq_id" roles, which are both "course" entities.

## Degree of a Relationship Set

The degree of a relationship is the **number** of entity sets related to it. Most relationship sets are **binary**. (_Ternary_ means degree of 3.)

## Attributes

Attributes can be classified as:

- Simple / composite
- Single-valued / multivalued (e.g. _phone\_numbers_)
- Derived (e.g. age)

**Domain** is the set of **permitted values** for each attribute.

## Mapping Cardinality Constraints

**Mapping cardinality** is the _number_ of _entities_ to which another entity can be associated via a relationship set. For a binary relationship, it must be one of following:

- One to one
- One to many
- Many to one
- Many to many

In ER diagram, a _directed line_ → specifies "_one_", an _undirected line_ — specifies "_many_".

## Participation

**Total participation** indicated by **double line** means every entity participates in _at least one_ relationship in the relationship set.

**Partial participation** is the opposite.

For more complex constraints, we use _l..h_ to represent the _minimum_ and _maximum_ cardinality. Specially, * is used to represent _no limit_.

For ternary or greater degree relationship, we allow at most one arrow out, that is, at most one _one-to-many_ relationship between an entity set and a relationship.

## Weak Entity Sets

A **weak entity set** is one whose existence is _dependent_ on another entity, called its **identifying entity**. Instead of associating a primary key with a weak entity, we use the **identifying entity** along with the extra attributes called **discriminator** to uniquely identify a weak entity.

Every **weak entity** must be associated with an **identifying entity**; that is, the **weak entity** is _existence dependent_ on the identifying entity set. The identifying entity set is said to _own_ the weak entity set. And the relationship associating the weak entity set with the identifying entity set is the **identifying relationship**.

In ER Diagrams, a **weak entity** set is expressed using a _double rectangle_. The **discriminator** of a weak entity set is underlined with a _dashed line_. For example,dra(—

![](/assets/img/contents/weak_entity_example.png)

the primary key for section - (course_id, sec_id, semester, year).

## Reduction to Relation Schemas

- A _strong entity_ set reduces to a schema with the same attributes. 
- A _weak entity_ set becomes a table including a column for the **primary key** of the **identifying strong entity set**.
- **Flatten out** _composite_ attributes by creating a separate attribute for each component attribute.
- **Ignore** _multivalued_ attributes.
- For _multivalued_ attributes, we use a separate schema having the **primary key** of the _entity_ and an attribute corresponding to _multivalued_ attribute.
- For _relationship_ sets, we adopt different strategies for different cases.
- We can avoid _redundancy_ for many-to-one or one-to-one relationship by adding the **primary key** of the one side to the attributes of the many side.
