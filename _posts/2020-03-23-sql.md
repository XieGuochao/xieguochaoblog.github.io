# Domain Types in SQL

SQL provides the following domain types: _char(n), varchar(n), int, smallint, numeric(p, d) (e.g. 44.5 for numeric(3,1), real, double precision, float(n) (at least n digits)._

# SQL Syntax

## CREATE TABLE

```sql
CREATE TABLE instructor(
    ID      char(5),
    name    varchar(20) not null,
    dept_name   varchar(20),
    salary      numeric(8, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_name) REFERENCES department
);
```

## INSERT

```sql
INSERT INTO instructor (ID, name)
    VALUES ('10211', 'Smith');
```

```sql
INSERT INTO instructor
    SELECT ID, name, dept_name, 18000
    FROM student
    WHERE dept_name = 'Music' AND total_cred > 144;
```

## UPDATE

```sql
UPDATE instructor
    SET salary = salary * 1.05
    WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG (salary) FROM instructor);
```

## CASE

```sql
UPDATE instructor
    SET salary = CASE
            WHEN salary <= 100000 THEN salary * 1.05
            ELSE salary * 1.03
        END
```

## DELETE

Remove **all** tuples from a relation satisfying constraints.

```sql
DELETE FROM student WHERE ...;
```

## DROP TABLE

Delete all tuples and schema for a relation.

```sql
DROP TABLE student;
```

## ALTER

```sql
ALTER TABLE r ADD A D;

ALTER TABLE r DROP A;
```

## SELECT

```sql
SELECT A1, A2, ..., An
FROM r1, r2, ..., rm
WHERE P;
```
Note: SQL names are **case insensitive**.

### DISTINCT

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT dept_name
FROM instructor
```

### ALL

Do not remove duplicates.

```sql
SELECT ALL dept_name
FROM instructor
```

### *

All attributes.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM instructor
```

### AS

- Rename a value or attribute.
- We can omitted `AS`.

```sql
SELECT ID, name, salary / 12 AS monthly_salary
FROM ...;

SELECT ID, name, salary / 12 monthly_salary
FROM ...;
```

## WHERE

- Allows logical connectives: **and, or, not**.
- Allow comparison operators **<, <=, >, >=, =, <>**.

### BETWEEN

```sql
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary BETWEEN 90000 and 100000;
```

is equivalent to

```sql
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary <= 100000 and salary >= 90000;
```


## FROM

The Cartesian product.

## LIKE: String Operations

- **%**: matches any substring
- **_**: matches any character.
- **\\**: Escape character.
- **\|\|**: Concatenation.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE name LIKE '%dar%';
```

## ORDER BY

- **desc**: descending order;
- **asc**: ascending order (default).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM instructor
ORDER BY name;
```

## Set Operations: UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT

- `UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT` are used for set operations.
- They **eliminates** duplicates.
- To retain all duplicates, use: `UNION ALL, INTERSECT ALL, EXCEPT ALL`.

## NULL, UNKNOWN

- Arithmetic expression involving `NULL` is `NULL`.
- `IS NULL` can be used to check for `NULL`.
- `IS NOT NULL` can be used to check for values not `NULL`.
- Comparing with `NULL` will result in `UNKNOWN`, which is between `TRUE` and `FALSE`.
- `WHERE NULL` is treated as `FALSE`.
- Use `IS UNKNOWN` to test for `UNKNOWN`.

## Aggregate Functions

- `AVG`
- `MIN`
- `MAX`
- `SUM`
- `COUNT`
- `GROUP BY`: Attributes in `SELECT` outside of aggregate functions **must** appear in `GROUP BY` list.
- `HAVING`: Applied **after** the formation of groups (`WHERE` is applied **before** forming groups).

```sql
SELECT dept_name, AVG (salary) AS avg_salary
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name;
```

```sql
SELECT dept_name, AVG (salary) AS avg_salary
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING AVG (salary) > 42000;
```

## IN

**Subquery**: a **select-from-where** expression that is nested within another query.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT course_id FROM section WHERE semester = 'Fall' AND year= 2017 AND course_id IN 
(SELECT course_id 
FROM section
WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year= 2018);
```

## SOME

`SOME` means at least 1.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > SOME (
    SELECT salary
    FROM instructor
    WHERE dept_name = 'Biology'
);
```

## ALL

`ALL` is similar to `SOME` in syntax.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE salary > ALL (
    SELECT salary
    FROM instructor
    WHERE dept_name = 'Biology'
);
```

## EXISTS

`EXISTS` means the following set is not empty.

All courses taught in both the Fall 2017 and Spring 2018.

```sql
SELECT course_id
FROM section S
WHERE semester = 'Fall' AND year = 2017 AND
    EXISTS (
        SELECT *
        FROM section T
        WHERE semester = 'Spring' AND year = 2018 AND
            S.course_id = T.course_id
    );
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT S.ID, S.name FROM student AS S 
WHERE NOT EXISTS 
( 
    (SELECT course_id FROM course WHERE dept_name = 'Biology') 
    EXCEPT 
    (SELECT T.course_id FROM takes AS T
    WHERE S.ID = T.ID)
);
```

Note that $X - Y = \emptyset \Leftrightarrow X \subseteq Y$.

## UNIQUE

`UNIQUE` tests whether a **subquery** has any **duplicate** tuples. Note: it also accept **empty set**.

The following will find all courses that were offered **at most** once in 2017:

```sql
SELECT T.course_id
FROM course AS T
WHERE UNIQUE (
    SELECT R.course_id
    FROM section R
    WHERE T.course_id = R.course_id AND R.year = 2017
);
```

## WITH

`WITH` provides a way of defining a **temporary** relation whose definition is available only to a query.

```sql
WITH max_budget(value) AS 
    (SELECT MAX(budget) FROM department)
SELECT department.name
FROM department, max_budget
WHERE department.budget = max_budget.value;
```

# Joined Relations

## Natural Join

- Match tuples with the same values for all common attributes (**inner** join)
- Retains only **one** copy of each common column (**natural**)

```sql
SELECT name, course_id
FROM students, takes
WHERE student.ID = takes.ID;
```

is equivalent to 

```sql
SELECT name, course_id
FROM student NATURAL JOIN takes;
```

## Outer Join

- Left outer join
- Right outer join
- Full outer join

## Join in SQL

1. `USING`: Two columns should have the same name.
2. `ON`: Not necessarily the same name.

```sql
[NATURAL]
ON (A1.XX = A2.XX)
USING (A1, A2, ..., An)
```
# View

A mechanism to hide certain data from the view of certain users.

```sql
CREATE VIEW v AS <expression>

CREATE VIEW faculty AS
    SELECT ID, name, dept_name
    FROM instructor;

SELECT name
FROM faculty
WHERE dept_name = 'Biology';
```

## Materialized View

Create **physical** copies for **views**. However, we need to **maintain** the view by updating the view whenever the underlying relations are updated.

## View Updates

In **MySQL**, a **view** update is related to its corresponding schemas. That is, updating a **view** will **change** its corresponding schemas.

# Transaction

A **transaction** consists of a sequence of query and / or update statements and is a "unit" of work. It should end with one of the following:

1. **COMMIT**
2. **ROLLBACK**

It is **atomic** and **isolated** from concurrent transactions.

# Referential Integrity

`FOREIGN KEY` is used for referencing. We can add **cascade** to foreign keys.

```sql
CREATE TABLE course (
    ...
    dept_name VARCHAR(20),
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_name) REFERENCES department
        ON DELETE CASCADE
        ON UPDATE CASCADE,
    ...
)
```

To insert a tuple without causing constraint violation, we may:

1. Insert **referenced** before we insert the current one.
2. Set **foreign key** to be **NULL** initially and update later.
3. Defer constraint checking.

# Date Types

1. `data`: `2005-7-27`
2. `time`: `09:00:30`, `09:00:30.75`
3. `timestamp`: `2005-7-27 09:00:30.75`

# Large-Object Types

1. `blob`: binary large object
2. `clob`: character large object

A **pointer** will be returned for the query of a large object.

# User-Defined Types

`CREATE TYPE` can be used to define a new type:

```sql
CREATE TYPE Dollars AS NUMERIC (12, 2) FINAL;

CREATE TABLE department
(
    dept_name VARCHAR(20),
    building VARCHAR(15),
    budget Dollars
);
```

# Domain

For a **domain** we can add constraints.

```sql
CREATE DOMAIN degree_level VARCHAR(10)
    CONSTRAINT degree_level_test
        CHECK (value IN ('Bachelors', 'Masters', 'Doctorate'));
```

# Index Creation

```sql
CREATE INDEX studentID_index on student(ID);
```

Then, the query

```sql
SELECT *
FROM student
WHERE ID = '12345';
```

can be executed by using the index without looking at all records of students.

# Authorization

- Read (Select)
- Insert
- Update
- Delete
- All privileges

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON department TO Amit, Satoshi;
REVOKE SELECT ON student FROM U1, U2;
```

## Role

```sql
CREATE ROLE instructor;
GRANT instructor TO Amit;
GRANT SELECT ON takes TO instructor;
```
