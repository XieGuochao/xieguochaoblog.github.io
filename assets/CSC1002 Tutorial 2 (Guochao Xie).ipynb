    "#### Assignment Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. It is probably the most frequently used operators in Python, because our codes usually manipulate variables. There are several assignment operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most basic one is `=`, for example `David = 100` means we assign the value `100` to the variable `David`. There are 2 cases for the variable `David`. On the one hand, `David` may be previously defined. In this case, `David` will _forget_ what it previously contains and now contain the new value `100`. On the other hand, if `David` never appears before, then Python will initiate a new variable called `David` and set its value to `100`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the basic `=`, Python also provides several operators that _update_ the variable's value. Here is a list of such operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `+=`\n",
    "- `-=`\n",
    "- `*=`\n",
    "- `/=`\n",
    "- `%=`\n",
    "- `**=`\n",
    "- `//=`\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to briefly introduce the machanism of `+=`. The operator `+=` will **increase** the variable on the **left** hand side by the value on the **right**. For example, \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(1)\n",
    "David = 10\n",
    "(2)\n",
    "David += 20\n",
    "(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At point 1, `David` has not been initiated and it does not have a value. At point 2, `David` is 10 now. And at point 3, `David` becomes `10 + 20` which equals to `30`. If you can understand this, then you can extend the idea to other operators as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Multiple Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple assignment is a special feature supported by Python. It allows you to have multiple variables and values on both side of `=`. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b = 10, 20\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have 2 variables on the left side adn 2 values on the right side. As a consequence, `a`, `b` will be set as `10` and `20` respectively. To help you better understand this feature, you may run and think about the following codes."
